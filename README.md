# Object Detection Using Deep Learning

It is a ML technique that trains with annotated visuals to identify and name objects within videos, static images, and live footage. Object detection machine learning projects comprise image classification, object localization, and pixel segmentation, helping boost your knowledge of Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNN).

## Deep Learning Framework

### Framework used: TensorFlow

 TensorFlow is a popular open-source deep learning framework developed by Google. It is designed to build and train large-scale neural networks for various tasks such as object detection, natural language processing, and image recognition. TensorFlow offers a lot of flexibility and supports various programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java.
